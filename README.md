# Arithmetic Operations Game

This repository contains the source code for an **Arduino-based** device that helps 
kids learn and practice fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

## Adjusting Difficulty

The difficulty can be adjusted in each one of the "Operation" classes:

| Operation      | Current                    |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Addition       | (0 to 10) + (0 to 10)      |
| Subtraction    | (1 to 10) - (0 to minuend) |
| Multiplication | (1 to 2) * (0 to 10)       |
| Division       | (0 to 20) / (2 to 9)       |
